Services
--------

by Roger Jungemann

A series of text services for OS X.

Right now, it consists of the following services:

* Copy to tmux—copy the current text selection the current tmux buffer
* Paste from tmux—paste whatever is in the current tmux buffer

Created using [ThisService](http://wafflesoftware.net/thisservice/), although
they could easily be created with Automator as well.
